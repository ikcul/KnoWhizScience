      "\n",
      "**LinkedList Class**\n",
      "\n",
      "The `LinkedList` class has several methods:\n",

      "* `reverse_recursive()`: Reverses the linked list using a recursive approach.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Calling the `_reverse_recursive()` helper function with the current head of the linked list.\n",
      "2. In the `_reverse_recursive()` function, it checks if the current node is the last node in the linked list. If it is, it returns the current node.\n",
      "3. If the current node is not the last node, it recursively calls `_reverse_recursive()` with the next node in the linked list.\n",
      "4. Once the recursive call returns, it updates the `next` pointer of the current node to point to the previous node.\n",
      "5. It returns the new head of the reversed linked list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Iterative Approach**\n",
      "\n",
      "The `reverse_iterative()` method uses an iterative approach to reverse the linked list. It works by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Initializing three pointers: `prev`, `current`, and `next_node`.\n",
      "2. Iterating through the linked list, updating the `next` pointer of each node to point to the previous node.\n",
      "3. Once the iteration is complete, it updates the `head` of the linked list to point to the new head of the reversed linked list.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Usage**\n",
      "\n",
      "The example usage demonstrates how to create a linked list, append nodes to it, and reverse it using both the recursive and iterative approaches. It prints the original and reversed linked lists to the console.\n"

then in the middle Justus went', 'off and did a very famous piece of work', 'and it was the first time that uh', 'someone made it real time right yeah', 'yeah so so the story there is there was',

need to play with it I need to make my', 'own images into van go so then I like', 'read the paper and over a long weekend I', 'reimplemented the thing and got it to', 'work it was a very actually very simple', 'algorithm um so like my implementation', 'was like 300 lines of Lua cuz at the', 'time it was pre it was Lua there was', 'there was um this was pre pie torch so', 'we were using Lua torch um but it was', 'like very simple algorithm but it was', 'slow right so it was an optim', 'optimization based thing every image you', 'want to generate you need to run this', 'optimization Loop run this gradient Dent', 'Loop for every image that you generate', 'the images were beautiful but I just', 'like wanted to be faster and and Justin', 'just did it and it was actually I think', 'your first taste', 'of a an academic work having an industry', 'impact a bunch of people seen this this', 'artistic style transfer stuff at the', 'time and me and a couple others at the', 'same time came up with different ways to', 'speed this up yeah um but mine was the', 'one that got a lot of traction right so', \"I was very proud of Justin but there's\", 'one more thing I was very proud of', 'Justin to connect to J AI is that before', \"the world understand gen Justin's last\", 'piece of uh uh work in PhD which I I', 'knew about it because I was forcing you', 'to do it that one was fun that was was', 'actually uh input', 'language and getting a whole picture out', \"it's one of the first gen uh work it's\", 'using gang which was so hard to use but', 'the problem is that we are not ready to',

technical um uh issue or or', 'technical uh story of pixels that most', \"people work in language don't realize is\", 'that pre era in the field of computer', 'vision those of us who work on pixels', 'we actually have a long history in a an', 'area of research called reconstruction', '3D reconstruction which is you know it', 'dates back from the 70s you know you can', 'take photos because humans have two eyes', 'right so in generally starts with stereo', 'photos and then you try to triangulate', 'the geometry and uh make a 3D shape out', 'of it it is a really really hard problem', \"to this day it's not fundamentally\", \"solved because there there's\", 'correspondence and all that and then so', 'this whole field which is a older way of', 'thinking about 3D has been going around', 'and it has been making really good', 'progress but when nerve happened when', 'Nerf happened in the context of', 'generative methods in the context of', 'diffusion models', 'suddenly reconstruction and generations', 'start to really merge and now like', 'within really a short period of time in', \"the field of computer vision it's hard\", 'to talk about reconstruction versus', 'generation anymore we suddenly have a', 'moment where if we see something or if', 'we imagine something both can converge', 'towards generating it right right and', \"that's just to me a a really important\", 'moment for computer vision but most', \"people missed it because we're not\", 'talking about it as much as llms right', \"so in pixel space there's reconstruction\", 'where you reconstruct', \"like a scene that's real and then if you\", \"don't see the scene then you use\", 'generative techniques right so these', 'things are kind of very similar', 'throughout this entire conversation', \"you're talking about languages and\", \"you're talking about pixels so maybe\", \"it's a good time to talk about how like\", \"space for intelligence and what you're\", 'working on', 'contrasts with language approaches which', 'of course are very popular now like is', 'it complimentary is it orthogonal yeah I', \"think I think they're complimentary I I\", \"don't mean to be too leading here like\", 'maybe just contrast them like everybody', 'says like listen I I I know opening up', 'and I know GPT and I know multimodal', \"models and a lot of what you're talking\", \"about is like they've got pixels and\", \"they've got languages and like doesn't\", 'this kind of do what we want to do with', 'spatial reasoning yeah so I think to do', 'that you need to open up the Black Box a', 'little bit of how these systems work', 'under the hood um so with language', 'models and the multimodal language', \"models that we're seeing nowadays\", \"they're their their underlying\", 'representation under the hood is is a', 'one-dimensional representation we talk', 'about context lengths we talk about', 'Transformers we talk about sequences', 'attention attention fundamentally their', 'representation of the world is is', 'onedimensional so these things', 'fundamentally operate on a', 'onedimensional sequence of tokens so', 'this is a very natural representation', \"when you're talking about language\", 'because written text is a', 'one-dimensional sequence of discret', 'letters so that kind of underlying', 'representation is the thing that led to', 'llms and now the multimodal llms that', \"we're seeing now you kind of end up\", 'shoehorning the other modalities into', 'this underlying representation of a 1D', 'sequence of tokens um now when we move', \"to spatial intelligence it's kind of\", \"going the other way where we're saying\", 'that the three-dimensional nature of the', 'world should be front and center in the', 'representation so at an algorithmic', 'perspective that opens up the door for', 'us to process data in different ways to', 'get different kinds of outputs out of it', 'um and to tackle slightly different', 'problems so even at at a course level', 'you kind of look at outside and you say', 'oh multimodal LMS can look at images too', \"well they can but I I think that it's\", \"they don't have that fundamental 3D\", 'representation at the heart of their', 'approaches I totally agree with Justin I', 'think talking about the 1D versus', 'fundamental 3D representation is one of', 'the most core differentiation the other', \"thing it's a slightly philosophical but\", \"it's really important to for me at least\", 'is language is fundamentally a purely', \"generated signal there's no language out\", \"there you don't go out in the nature and\", \"there's words written in the sky for you\", 'whatever data you feeding you pretty', 'much can just somehow regurgitate with', 'enough', 'generalizability at the the same data', \"out and that's language to language and\", 'but but 3D World Is Not There is a 3D', 'world out there that follows laws of', 'physics that has its own structures due', 'to materials and and many other things', 'and to to fundamentally back that', 'information out and be able to represent', 'it and be able to generate it is just', 'fundamentally quite a different', 'problem we will be borrowing um similar', 'ideas or useful ideas from language and', 'llms but this is fundamentally', 'philosophically to me a different', 'problem right so language 1D and', 'probably a bad representation of the', \"physical world because it's been\", \"generated by humans and it's probably\", \"lossy there's a whole another modality\", 'of generative AI models which are pixels', 'and these are 2D image and 2D video and', 'like one could say that like if you look', 'at a video it looks you know you can see', '3D stuff because like you can pan a', 'camera or whatever it is and so like how', 'would like spatial intelligence be', 'different than say 2D video here when I', \"think about this it's useful to\", 'disentangle two things um one is the', 'underlying representation and then two', 'is kind of the the user facing', \"affordances that you have um and here's\", 'where where you can get sometimes', 'confused because um fundamentally we see', '2D right like our retinas are 2D', \"structures in our bodies and we've got\", 'two of them so like fundamentally our', 'visual system some perceives 2D images', 'um but the problem is that depending on', 'what representation you use there could', 'be different affordances that are more', 'natural or less natural so even if you', 'are at the end of the day you might be', 'seeing a 2D image or a 2d video um your', 'brain is perceiving that as a projection', \"of a 3D World so there's things you\", 'might want to do like move objects', 'around move the camera around um in', 'principle you might be able to do these', 'with a purely 2D representation and', \"model but it's just not a fit to the\", \"problems that you're the model to do\", 'right like modeling the 2D projections', 'of a dynamic 3D world is is a function', 'that probably can be modeled but by', 'putting a 3D representation Into the', \"Heart of a model there's just going to\", 'be a better fit between the kind of', 'representation that the model is working', 'on and the kind of tasks that you want', 'that model to do so our bet is that by', 'threading a little bit more 3D', \"representation under the hood that'll\", 'enable better affordances for for users', 'and this also goes back to the norstar', 'for me you know why is it spatial', 'intelligence why is it not flat pixel', 'intelligence is because I think the Arc', 'of intelligence has to go to what Justin', 'calls affordances and uh and the Arc of', 'intelligence if you look at Evolution', 'right the Arc of intelligence eventually', 'enables animals and humans especially', 'human as an

the', \"but it's innately 3D um to me I think\", 'this is actually very subtle yeah and', 'Incredibly critical point and so I think', \"it's worth digging into and a good way\", 'to do this is talking about use cases', \"and so just to level set this we're\", 'talking about generating a technology', \"let's call it a model that can do\", 'spatial intelligence so maybe in the', 'abstract what might that look like kind', 'of a little bit more concretely what', 'would be the potential use cases that', 'you could apply this to so I think', \"there's a there's a couple different\", 'kinds of things we imagine these', 'spatially intelligent models able to do', \"over time um and one that I'm really\", \"excited about is World Generation we're\", \"all we're all used to something like a\", 'text

not\", 'getting just an image out or just a clip', \"out but you're getting out a full\", 'simulated but vibrant and interactive 3D', 'World for gaming maybe for gaming right', 'maybe for gaming maybe for virtual', \"photography like you name it there's I\", 'think there even if you got this to work', \"there'd be there'd be a million\", 'applications for Education yeah for', 'education I mean I guess one of one of', 'my things is that like we in in some', 'sense this enables a new form of media', 'right because we already have the', 'ability to create virtual interactive', 'world worlds um but it cost hundreds of', 'hundreds of millions of dollars and a', 'and a ton of development time and as a', 'result like what are the places that', 'people drive this technological ability', 'is is video games right because if we do', 'have the ability as a society to create', 'amazingly detailed virtual interactive', 'worlds that give you amazing experiences', 'but because it takes so much labor to do', 'so then the only economically viable use', 'of that technology in its form today is', 'is games that can be sold for $70 a', 'piece to millions and millions of people', 'to recoup the investment if we had the', 'ability to create these same virtual', 'interactive vibrant 3D worlds um you', 'could see a lot of other applications of', 'this right because if you bring down', 'that

spatial intelligence in the', 'generative Realms if I think about a', 'world I actually think about things that', 'are not just seene generation I think', 'about stuff like movement and physics', 'and so like like in the limit is that', 'included and then the second one is', \"absolutely if I'm interacting with it\", 'like like are there semantics and I mean', 'by that like if I open a book are there', 'like pages and are there words in it and', 'do they mean like like are we talking', 'like a full depth experience or we', 'talking about like kind of a static', \"scene I think I'll see a

be fully Dynamic fully', 'interactable all the things that you', \"just said I mean that's the definition\", 'of spatial intelligence yeah so so there', \"is going to be a progression we'll start\", \"with more static but everything you've\", 'said is is in the in the road map of uh', 'spatial intelligence I mean this is kind', 'of in in the name of the company itself', 'World Labs um like the world is about', 'building and understanding worlds and', 'and like this is actually a little bit', 'inside baseball I realized after we told', \"the name to people they don't always get\", 'it because in computer vision and and', 'reconstruction and generation we often', 'make a distinction or a delineation', 'about the kinds of things you can do um', 'and kind of the first level is
